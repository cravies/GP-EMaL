TODO before break:
- [ ] Test new (faster) runtime complexity on mfat dataset, look at pareto front and tree plots
- [ ] Parallelise code and check it runs faster 
- [ ] Implement tree skewness
- [x] Implement functional dictionary complexity
- [ ] Investigate optimising multiple objectives (not just 2)
